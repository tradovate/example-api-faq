# Tradovate API FAQ
### Understanding Core Features of the API

The Tradovate API has a very wide range of features - every bit of functionality available in the Trader Application is built upon the API. Because of the scope of the API, it’s important to take some time to understand how it is structured and what core features are available to prospective developers.
