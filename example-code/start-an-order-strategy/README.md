# Start an Order Strategy

This is a working sample that allows a client to start an order strategy. To use this project, clone the repo and navigate to the containing folder using the command line. Be sure to navigate to this project's containing folder (`user-sync-request`). Then run this command:

```
yarn install
```

You can then run the application using this command:

```
yarn start
```

Be sure to fill out your credentials in the `data.js` file. You can also change the parameters of your request in `data.js`. Once you're satisfied with the data and have filled in your own credentials, start the app and press the 'Start order' button. You can watch the developers' console to see details, and the network panel will log all websocket activity while the tab is open.
